        <h3>Movie Recommender</h3>
        <p>When I watch a movie with my film friends, they always take too long to select the perfect movie to watch. Often times spending longer thinking about what movie to watch than actually watching a movie. This project would fix this issue, being able to recommend movies instantaneously. Powered by a ML model, it takes a list of movies and their user ratings and outputs a movie recommendation.  </p>
